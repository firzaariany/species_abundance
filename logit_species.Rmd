## Description

The project is aimed to understand the occurrences of tree species under
different temperature range. 

The information collected from this project can be useful to understand the
*distribution of tree species along elevational gradient* such as in mountain
forests. This is because elevational gradient is followed by temperature
gradient. 

Different temperatures along elevational gradient affect the distribution of
tree species because they require different temperature range to live optimally. 

## Disclaimer

This was a part of school project. Datasets were provided by my teacher from
AgroParisTech & Universit√© de Lorraine, [Dr. Paulina Pinto](http://siafee.agroparistech.fr/pinto-paulina). I wrote the scripts under
her guidance. 

## Datasets

ecoflo dataset extracted from:  

* [Ecoplant](https://silvae.agroparistech.fr/home/?page_id=173), a database for soil and floristic data  
* Sophy  

Within the ecoflo dataset, there are:

* Floristic data that contains the presence/absence (1/0) of three tree species    
* Ecological data that contains:  
    + The elevation (alt)  
    + Optimal pH (VI pH)  
    + Soil condition (VI C/N)  
    + Average temperature in January (mt1), in July (mt7), and annual (mt13)  
    + Climatic water balance in July (bh7)  

```{r import file}
ecoflo = read.table("ecoflo.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ";")
```

Some remarks about the variables in the dataset:  

* Placette        : identifier for each tree observations 
* Periode         : if the observation is from old or new records    
* Massif          : the name of the mountains where the (tree) records were taken  
* xLamb and yLamb : geo-position of the records  
* Annee           : the year the records were taken  
* Alt             : the latitude of the records  
* VIpH            : the optimal pH for the tree species  
* VICN            : the optimal soil condition for the tree species (CN means Carbon-Nitrogen ratio, it shows the amount of mineral contained in the soil. These are the organic materials that all tree species need to have)  
* Tree species    : there are three species in this dataset  
    + *Abies alba* (fir)  
    + *Larix decidua* (larch)  
    + *Quercus robur* (pedunculate oak)  
    + *Carpinus betulus* (Hornbeam)  
    + *Vaccinium myrtillus* (berry bush)  
* mt1             : average temperature in January  
* mt7             : average temperature in July  
* mt13            : annual average temperature  
* bh7             : climatic water balance in July
